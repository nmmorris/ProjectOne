## Project One: Physical and Mental Character Creator for P5.js
#### by Natalie Morris



### Overview

This program prompts the user with a series of personality quiz questions, asking
them to reflect on who they are, what they value, and how they feel. With each
answer, a new part of their character, a manifestation of their personality, is 
created! 

The character is made up of png files that are drawn on the screen through
various functions after each question is answered. The answers can be clicked like
buttons that use an object class to allow them to be clicked and functional. The 
questions function as moodstates, which can be navigated through backwards and
forwards as the user chooses.


### Technical Details

This program includes the clickable class to make use of button objects, moodstate functions for each stage of the program, and draw functions to create images.
